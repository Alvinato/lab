title: D3 to React
---

The following graph is built using D3. It is converted into React elements which are rendered into the document. I am yet to try animations or check how fast this process is.

This was born from not liking the way D3 sits within React, it's a little island of state that I want to blow out of the water. My only gripe with D3 is that I wish it was essentially a React render function. Props go in, ReactElements come out. Simple.

I'll experiment further, probably on this page or subsequent ones.

<style>
.bar {
  font: 10px sans-serif;
  background-color: steelblue;
  text-align: right;
  padding: 3px;
  margin: 1px;
  color: white;
}
</style>

<div id="mount"></div>
