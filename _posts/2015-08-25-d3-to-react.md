title: D3 to React
---

The following values are built using D3. They are then converted into React elements which are rendered into the document. It's far from perfect (className != class, style must be an object not a string) but it's just a little experiment. I would like to get more properties working and then I'd like to try things like animation / performance.

This was born from not liking the way D3 sits within React, it's a little island of state that I want to blow out of the water. My only gripe with D3 is that I wish it was essentially a React render function. Props go in, ReactElements come out. Simple.

I'll experiment further, probably on this page or subsequent ones.
